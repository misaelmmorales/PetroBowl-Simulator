# PetroBowl Simulator

This is an R/Shiny application design to emulate the SPE PetroBowl competition.
- Each game consists of N questions and T minutes - normally, N=40 and T=8 minutes.
- The fastest player to answer for each team must provide their answer, and if correct then that team earns 10 points. If incorrect, they lose 5 points and the turn goes to the other team, with the same scoring criteria.
- Each player has 15 seconds to answer their question after buzzing in, or skip to the next question without buzzing (once you buzz, whatever answer you provide - even if blank - will be counted toward the scoring).

- Please use your own question-answer set for this simulator. The preferred format is MS Excel. A sample file (sample_Qbank.xlsx) is uploaded to demonstrate the format/headers of the .xlsx document
